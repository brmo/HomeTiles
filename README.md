## ESP32-P4 Home Assistant Display

<img align="right" width="38%" src="docs/images/b4-home.png" alt="Waveshare B4 home dashboard">

Tile-based ESP32-P4 firmware for Home Assistant dashboards with a fully configurable web interface.

The project currently supports multiple ESP32-P4 display devices and combines:

- touch-first dashboard UI
- MQTT-based Home Assistant integration
- on-device web configuration
- microSD-backed runtime storage

<br clear="both">

## Overview

This firmware turns supported ESP32-P4 touch displays into configurable Home Assistant control panels.

Everything visible on the dashboard is tile-based and managed from the built-in web interface:
- add, remove, move, and resize tiles
- configure tile content and behavior
- create folders and navigation structures
- manage WiFi, MQTT, language, and time zone settings without changing code

## Supported Devices

- [M5Stacks Tab5](https://shop.m5stack.com/products/m5stack-tab5-iot-development-kit-esp32-p4)
- [Waveshare B4](https://www.waveshare.com/esp32-p4-wifi6-touch-lcd-4b.htm)

Device-specific Arduino IDE settings are documented in [BOARD_SETTINGS.md](BOARD_SETTINGS.md).

## Screenshots

The screenshots below were captured on the Waveshare B4. They are meant as example views of the UI; the same firmware and web admin panel also run on the M5Stacks Tab5.

## Installation

### Option 1: Prebuilt Binaries

If release binaries are available, download the files matching your device:

- `...m5stacks-tab5-factory.bin`
- `...m5stacks-tab5-update.bin`
- `...waveshare-b4-factory.bin`
- `...waveshare-b4-update.bin`

Use:
- `factory.bin` for a clean first flash
- `update.bin` for updating an existing device

When using the ESP Flash Download Tool:
- flash `factory.bin` at `0x00000`
- flash `update.bin` at `0x10000`
- a manual reset after flashing may be required

### Option 2: Build From Source

1. Open [ESP32_P4_HomeAssistant_Display.ino](ESP32_P4_HomeAssistant_Display.ino) in the Arduino IDE.
2. Select the target device in [src/devices/device_select.h](src/devices/device_select.h).
3. Apply the correct board settings from [BOARD_SETTINGS.md](BOARD_SETTINGS.md).
4. Build and flash the firmware.

## First Setup

1. Insert a microSD card formatted as FAT32.
2. Flash the firmware.
3. Boot the device.
4. Open the temporary device WiFi Access Point if needed.
5. Configure WiFi and MQTT in the built-in web interface.
6. Open the web admin panel through the device IP address.
7. Configure your tiles, folders, and layout.

## Home Assistant Integration

This firmware expects the Home Assistant side to be provided by the MQTT bridge/integration:

- [ha-tab5-mqtt-bridge](https://github.com/GalusPeres/ha-tab5-mqtt-bridge)

That integration handles the Home Assistant-side MQTT communication and entity bridge.

## Repository Structure

- `src/` firmware source code
- `docs/images/` screenshots and documentation images
- `electron-app/` optional desktop companion tooling
- `mdi-extractor/` icon tooling
- `simconnect-bridge/` additional companion tooling
- `BOARD_SETTINGS.md` documented Arduino IDE board settings

## Notes

- OTA is not implemented yet.
- The microSD card is part of the expected runtime setup and should not be treated as optional.
- Board selection and board settings must match the target device.
