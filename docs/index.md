# HomeTiles

Tile-based firmware that turns ESP32-P4 touch displays into Home Assistant control
panels — configured entirely in the browser, updated over the air, connected via MQTT.

## New Here? Four Steps

<div class="ht-steps" markdown>

1.  **Flash the firmware**

    Download the prebuilt binaries for your device and flash them once over
    USB — every update after that installs over the air.

    [Flashing the Firmware :octicons-arrow-right-24:](flashing.md)

2.  **Connect everything**

    Set up the MQTT broker, install the bridge integration, and pair the
    display with Home Assistant.

    [Home Assistant Setup :octicons-arrow-right-24:](home-assistant-setup.md)

3.  **Build your dashboard**

    Open the display's admin panel in your browser: click a cell, pick a tile
    type, done. Drag & drop, folders, everything saves automatically.

    [Web Admin Panel :octicons-arrow-right-24:](web-admin.md)

4.  **Use the display**

    Control lights with a color wheel, check sensor history, energy statistics,
    weather, and media — all in touch popups on the device.

## New In v0.6.0

Climate controls are now a first-class part of the dashboard. Climate tiles have
a configurable mini-tile grid for current values, targets, humidity, and mode,
while the on-device popup exposes the temperature, preset, fan, and swing controls
that the selected Home Assistant entity actually supports.

The web preview and device renderer share the same layout rules across the
M5Stack Tab5, Waveshare 4B, and Waveshare 8-inch display. This release also
improves network transport recovery and hardens the ESP-Hosted SDIO path.

## Supported Devices

| Device | Display |
| --- | --- |
| [M5Stack Tab5](https://shop.m5stack.com/products/m5stack-tab5-iot-development-kit-esp32-p4) | 5" 1280×720 |
| [Waveshare ESP32-P4-WIFI6-Touch-LCD-4B](https://www.waveshare.com/esp32-p4-wifi6-touch-lcd-4b.htm) | 4" 720×720 |
| [Waveshare ESP32-P4-WIFI6-Touch-LCD-8](https://www.waveshare.com/esp32-p4-wifi6-touch-lcd-7-8-10.1.htm) | 8" 1280×800 |

The same firmware runs on all devices; every release ships prebuilt binaries for each.

## How It Works

<div class="ht-flow">
  <span class="ht-node">Display</span>
  <span class="ht-link">←&thinsp;MQTT&thinsp;→</span>
  <span class="ht-node">MQTT Broker</span>
  <span class="ht-link">←&thinsp;MQTT&thinsp;→</span>
  <span class="ht-node">Bridge Integration<small>Home Assistant</small></span>
</div>

The display never talks to Home Assistant directly. The
[bridge integration](bridge.md) pushes entity states, icons, weather, history,
and energy data over MQTT — and executes the commands the display sends back.
Firmware and bridge are MIT-licensed and developed together.
